# Redux-Toolkit Essentials Guide

A modern approach to Redux state management using **Redux-Toolkit** (RTK), the official recommended library for simplifying Redux code.

## Key Features âœ¨
- Simplified Redux setup and syntax
- Built-in Redux DevTools integration
- Reduced boilerplate code
- Modern patterns for actions, reducers, and store configuration

---

## Core Methods & Concepts

### 1. `configureStore`
Automatically creates a Redux store with DevTools integration:
```javascript
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import taskReducer from "./tasks";
import employeeReducer from "./employees";

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    tasks: taskReducer,
    employees: employeeReducer
  }
});
```

### 2. `createAction`
Generates action creators with payload handling:
```javascript
import { createAction } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const addTask = createAction('ADD_TASK');
console.log(addTask({ task: 'New task!' })); 
// Output: { type: 'ADD_TASK', payload: { task: 'New task!' } }
```

### 3. `createReducer`
Creates reducers without switch/if-else statements (uses Immer for mutable-style updates):
```javascript
import { createReducer } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = [];
const taskReducer = createReducer(initialState, {
  ADD_TASK: (state, action) => {
    state.push({ ...action.payload, completed: false });
  }
});
```

### 4. `createSlice` (Recommended)
**Combines actions + reducers in one slice**:
```javascript
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
let id = 0;

const taskSlice = createSlice({
  name: "tasks",
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    addTask: (state, action) => {
      state.push({
        id: ++id,
        task: action.payload.task,
        completed: false
      });
    },
    removeTask: (state, action) => {
      return state.filter(task => task.id !== action.payload.id);
    },
    completedTask: (state, action) => {
      const task = state.find(task => task.id === action.payload.id);
      if (task) task.completed = true;
    }
  }
});

// Auto-generated action creators
export const { addTask, removeTask, completedTask } = taskSlice.actions;
export default taskSlice.reducer;
```

---

## Combining Reducers
RTK simplifies reducer combination using object syntax:
```javascript
// store.js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import taskReducer from "./tasks";
import employeeReducer from "./employees";

export default configureStore({
  reducer: {
    tasks: taskReducer,
    employees: employeeReducer
  }
});
```

## Key Benefits ðŸš€
- **Immer Integration**: Write "mutating" immutable updates
- **Code Organization**: Co-locate actions and reducers
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript support
- **Zero Config**: DevTools enabled by default
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Minimal setup required

---

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```
2. Create feature slices using `createSlice`
3. Combine reducers in your store with `configureStore`
4. Connect components to the store with `useSelector/useDispatch`
